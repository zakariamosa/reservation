## Sample list of items for the reservation system
## Each line contains a category followed by a separator and the item name.
## Supported separators are comma (,), pipe (|), dash (-) or semicolon (;).
## For example: dishes|Falafel Dish
## If no separator is found the entire line is treated as both the category and item name.
